            <p>My name is Edgar Granados-Perez and I am from Memphis, Tennessee. Although I was not born in the volunteer state I consider it my home.
                My family immigrated here from Hidalgo, Mexico when I was three. Being an immigrant has taught me many things but one of the most treasured lessons I have learned has been
                to always be open to learn. That is what brought me to computer science. Growing up I didn't come across many oppurtunities as my peers, one of the was having internet at home.
                My older brother was given a PC for his birthday and used to doodle on MS Paint all the time. Me being the annoying little brother that I was. I constantly asked him to let me use
                use the computer, which my brother strongly declined to do so. I would say him saying "no" was probably one of the best things to happen to me. It lead to me to research how a computer
                functions and what other purposes it had other than doodling. I learned about networking to solve my internet issue and learned about google docs when it released to public. A tool that
                helped me do countless of papers for free. Ironically enough I never figured how to use paint on windows vista to doodle, but honestly that is a small price to pay for an immense amount of 
                knowledge.

            <p>I have only done two personal projects. Those being a tax write off program which was written in Python
                and the other was a bot used to buy the RTX 3080 cards. Sadly I do not upload my creations to gitHub.
